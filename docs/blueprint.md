# **App Name**: Rainbow Timer

## Core Features:

- Circular Time Input: A dial interface for setting a timer by dragging to a time duration. This time duration will be expressed by the area subtended by the arc between zero and the user input, forming a gauge of the amount of time set. There are ticks for every five minutes.
- Rainbow Gauge: The circular arc representing the time duration will use rainbow colors.
- Visual Timer: The selected arc progressively disappears to provide an intuitive sense of the time remaining.
- Dynamic Reset: The timer resets, adopting a new value, based on user's actions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for the clock face to ensure clarity and contrast.
- Background color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) to provide a soft, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A rainbow gradient to represent time, making the app visually appealing and intuitive, with each 5-minute interval having a distinct color.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for its clear legibility and modern aesthetic. The ticks will have the font set on them.
- The clock face will be centrally located, dominating the screen to focus user interaction.
- Smooth and fluid animation of the rainbow arc disappearing to indicate time elapsed.
